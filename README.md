# Work-Day-Scheduler

The task was to create a simple calendar aplication that allows to plan daily activities and be able to save them. This have to be done by using jQuery to achieve a dynamically update HTML and CSS.

First, the main Html structure was created, incluiding the tag where the calendar was going to be nested. I used Bootstrap directly on the html to give style to the few elements that were not going to be created in Javascript. After the Html was done, I started the Javascript coding trying to use only jQuery. I started with the clock and added and update function, later I added a refresh function here for the colors of the calendar to change everyhour. I created a base array for the Calendar objects and created the variables that I was going to need at first. Then I worked on the function for rendering the calendar by creating the elements, adding styles with Bootstrap classes and CSSm, and adding them to the base HTML. After that, I made sure that the elements were able to be saved and loaded to the local storage. When the Javascript was finished, I polished the webpage format with some CSS and Google Fonts.
